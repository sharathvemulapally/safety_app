Background:
Communication is key for many aspects of a successful construction project and to ensure safe worker
construction. With that in mind, communication barriers exist between project management and field
supervision staff (mostly English-speaking and non-Hispanic) and non-English construction workers. The
construction industry was responsible for the greatest number of Latino worker deaths (Department of
Labor). Latino contractor deaths have increased by 74% between 2012 and 2017 (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services). Communication barriers were one of the major reasons why injury rates were
identified as 2.89 times higher for Hispanic workers compared to non-Hispanic workers (Riester, et.al.,
2018).

Research Problem:
There are challenges with communicating with non-English speaking workers by English speaking workers.
Current practices of using Google Translate and Siri are ineffective as they use European-based dialects of
Spanish, which can confuse the workers. Additionally, single-word commands identified in other research
efforts can also cause confusion and not be understood if the worker does not fully understand the context
or what they may be doing wrong. Lastly, some workers have literacy issues with writing and reading, so
providing written cards also has drawbacks.
